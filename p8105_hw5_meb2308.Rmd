# Problem 1

The data for this problem were compiled by _The Washington Post_ and include information on more than 52,000 criminal homicides that occurred over the past decade in 50 major U.S. cities. 

```{r}
homicides = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide_data.csv")
```

The dataset contains `r nrow(homicides)` rows and `r ncol(homicides)` columns, with each row representing a single homicide. The variables are location of a homicide (latitude and longitude), whether an arrest was made, and demographic information about the victim. 

The following code chunks create a `city_state` variable and provides a table of the number of unresolved homicides and total number of homicides by city.

```{r}
homicides_city = 
  homicides %>% 
  unite("city_state", city:state, sep = ", ", remove = TRUE)
```

```{r}
homicides_city %>% 
  
  knitr::kable()
```

# Problem 1

The data for this problem were compiled by *The Washington Post* and
include information on more than 52,000 criminal homicides that occurred
over the past decade in 50 major U.S. cities.

``` r
homicides = 
  read_csv("./hom_data/homicide_data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The dataset contains 52179 rows and 12 columns, with each row
representing a single homicide. The variables are location of a homicide
(latitude and longitude), whether an arrest was made, and demographic
information about the victim.

The following code chunks create a `city_state` variable and provide the
proportion of unsolved homicides (number of unresolved homicides / total
number of homicides) by city.

``` r
homicide_df =
  homicides %>% 
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  unite("city_state", city:state, sep = ", ", remove = TRUE) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state !="Tulsa, AL")
```

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Try a proportion test for Boston, MA

``` r
prop.test(
  310, 
  614)
```

    ## 
    ##  1-sample proportions test with continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  310 out of 614, null probability 0.5
    ## X-squared = 0.040717, df = 1, p-value = 0.8401
    ## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.4646219 0.5450881
    ## sample estimates:
    ##        p 
    ## 0.504886

Prepare for iteration

``` r
prop.test(
    aggregate_df %>%  filter(city_state == "Boston, MA") %>%  pull(hom_unsolved),
    aggregate_df %>%  filter(city_state == "Boston, MA") %>%  pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8

results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust =1))
```

Chicago, Illinois has the largest proportion of unsolved homicides and
Richmond, Virginia has the lowest proportion.

# Problem 2

This problem uses data from a longitudinal study with a control and
experimental arm and 8 weeks of observation.

First, I’ll create a tidy dataframe with the participants’ subject IDs,
study arms, and observations over time.

  - I used map to iterate over file names and read in data and saved
    each result as new variable in a dataframe.

  - I tidied the result by manipulating file names to include control
    arm and subject ID then made sure weekly observations were tidy.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
long_study_df =
  tibble(
    path = list.files("./data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/", path),
    path_names = path,
    data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  separate(col = path_names, into = c("path_arm", "path_id"), sep = 9) %>% 
  separate(col = path_id, into = c("id", ".csv"), sep = 2) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = recode(path_arm, "data/con_" = "control", 
    "data/exp_" = "experimental")) %>% 
  select(arm, id, data) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation"
    )
```

The following code creates a spaghetti plot showing observations on each
subject over time.

``` r
long_study_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, 
    group = arm, color = arm)) +
  geom_path() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Experimental vs Control Group Obervations over Time",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw5_meb2308_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot shows that the study outcome increased within the experimental
over the 8 week period but remained relatively constant within the
control group.

# Problem 3

First I will will set some design elements for later simulations.

  - Fix n=30
  - Fix σ=5 (variance = σ^2)
  - Set μ=0 (mean)

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

This code generates 5000 datasets from the model.

``` r
?rnorm
```

``` r
simulation = function(n = 30, beta0 = 2, beta1) {

sim_data = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, 0, 25)
  )



linear_model = lm(y ~ x, sim_data) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable

}

t.test(y ~ x, sim_data)
```

    ## Error in eval(m$data, parent.frame()): object 'sim_data' not found

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05

First dataset:

``` r
sim_results = 
  rerun(5000, simulation(30, 5, 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## Error in .::knitr: unused argument (kable)

Iterate over all 5000 datasets:

``` r
sim_results = 
  tibble(beta1 = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    sim_lists = map(.x = beta1, ~rerun(5000, simulation(beta1 = .x))),
    sim_estimates = map(sim_lists, bind_rows)
    ) %>%     
  select(~sim_estimates) %>% 
  unnest(sim_estimates)
```

    ## Error: Problem with `mutate()` input `sim_lists`.
    ## x unused argument (kable)
    ## ℹ Input `sim_lists` is `map(.x = beta1, ~rerun(5000, simulation(beta1 = .x)))`.

To obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy to clean the output
of t.test.

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and complete the following:

  - Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected
    (the power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the
    x axis. Describe the association between effect size and power.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
prop_reject_plot =
  sim_results %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  mutate(
    reject = ifelse(p.value < '0.05', 1, 0)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(beta1) %>% 
  summarise(prop_reject = mean(reject)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta1, y = prop_reject)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of times null hypothesis was rejected",
    x = "True value of μ",
    y = "Power"
  )
```

    ## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'sim_results' not found

  - Make a plot showing the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the
    true value of μ on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the
    first) the average estimate of μ̂ only in samples for which the null
    was rejected on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.

(filter to have less than 0.5 for p value)

Is the sample average of μ̂ across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of μ ? Why or why not?

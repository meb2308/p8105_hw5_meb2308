# Problem 1

The data for this problem were compiled by *The Washington Post* and
include information on more than 52,000 criminal homicides that occurred
over the past decade in 50 major U.S. cities.

``` r
homicides = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide_data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The dataset contains 52179 rows and 12 columns, with each row
representing a single homicide. The variables are location of a homicide
(latitude and longitude), whether an arrest was made, and demographic
information about the victim.

The following code creates a `city_state` variable and provides a table
of the number of unresolved homicides and total number of homicides by
city.

``` r
homicides_city = 
  homicides %>% 
  unite("city_state", city:state, sep = ", ", remove = TRUE)
```
